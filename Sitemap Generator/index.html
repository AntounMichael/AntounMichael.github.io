    <h2>For IDL Website, Summer 2018</h2>

<div class="content">
    <p><strong>Sitemap: </strong>a file containing a list of URLs for search engines to crawl</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.idl.ucsf.edu">Industry Documents Library</a> webiste has lacked a
        sitemap for the past few years, which is problematic, as it decreases potential usership
        by making it impossible for people to access IDL's documents directly from their 
        browser's search engine. Creating the sitemap for IDL is a difficult task because their 
        database of documents includes some 14.8 million documents, each with their own unique 
        URL that must be listed in the sitemap. Additionally, we needed not only a sitemap for
        all the current URLs, but rather a programmatic solution that regenerates a sitemap every
        time the site is updated, keeping search engines up to date on what sites need to be crawled.
        This means that however the sitempa is generated, it must be done in an efficient manner 
        to avoid overloading the server and to make runtime reasonable.
        <br/>
        This was my first exposure to using and communicating with databases, so I needed to learn 
        rudimentary SQL to be able to query the server from a script using an external library. I 
        used DbVisualizer as well to get used to querying the database and practice using SQL queries.
