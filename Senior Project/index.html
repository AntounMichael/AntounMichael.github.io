                <h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
                <p> For this project, my team and I were tasked with making a weather station which could work remotely in an area with no 
                    cell connection. use at a model aircraft field, so . I was responsible
                    for providing reliable power to the station. The battery was charged by the solar cell and discharged to the arduino using a charge controller circuit.
                    In designing the system, we computed the average energy usage needed to record, compute, and
                    transmit readings and allowed enough capacity to keep the system running even if there is no solar
                    power for several days. From there, all the parts were assembled and tested, then integrated into
                    the final unit (seen on the right).</p>
